# Weather Analytics with dbt

## Business Problem Solved
Transforms raw weather data into analytics-ready business intelligence. Creates clean, tested, and documented data models that enable reliable reporting, trend analysis, and operational decision-making based on weather patterns.

## Solution Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Raw Weather Data (PostgreSQL) 
    ↓ 
dbt Staging Models (data cleaning & validation)
    ↓
dbt Mart Models (business aggregations & trends)
    ↓
Business Intelligence Tables (ready for dashboards)
```

### Tech Stack
- **dbt**: Data transformation and modeling
- **PostgreSQL**: Data warehouse and analytics storage
- **Airflow**: Orchestration and pipeline monitoring
- **Python**: Business logic and quality validation

## Why This Approach

### dbt Value Proposition
- **Version-controlled analytics**: All business logic in SQL, tracked in git
- **Automated testing**: Data quality validation with every run
- **Self-documenting**: Models include business context and lineage
- **Team collaboration**: Consistent patterns for multiple developers

### When dbt Makes Sense
- ✅ Multiple people need to work with the same data transformations
- ✅ Business logic needs to be documented and version-controlled
- ✅ Data quality testing is critical for reliable analytics
- ✅ You want to separate data ingestion from data modeling

## dbt Models

### Staging Layer (`models/staging/`)
**Purpose**: Clean and standardize raw weather data

**`stg_weather_data.sql`**
- Basic data cleaning and type casting
- Temperature categorization (freezing, cold, mild, warm, hot)
- Data quality filters and validation
- Adds business-friendly derived fields

### Marts Layer (`models/marts/`)
**Purpose**: Create analytics-ready business tables

**`daily_weather_summary.sql`**
- Daily temperature aggregations (min, max, avg)
- Weather condition analysis
- Data quality assessment
- Business temperature categories

**`weather_trends.sql`**
- 7-day rolling averages
- Day-over-day and week-over-week comparisons
- Trend indicators (warming, cooling, stable)
- Performance optimized (90-day rolling window)

### Data Quality (`tests/`)
**`temperature_range_test.sql`**
- Validates temperatures are reasonable for Prague climate
- Catches data anomalies and API errors
- Ensures logical consistency (min < max temperatures)

## Airflow Integration

### Pipeline Orchestration
**DAG**: `weather_analytics_dbt`
- **Schedule**: Daily at 3:00 AM (after data ingestion)
- **Dependencies**: Waits for `accuweather_daily` DAG completion
- **Tasks**: Validate → Transform → Test → Report

### Business Intelligence Features
- **Data freshness validation** before running transformations
- **Automated quality testing** with failure notifications
- **Business summary generation** with key metrics
- **Stakeholder-friendly email reports**

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive failure notifications with technical details
- Data quality alerts when validation fails
- Graceful handling of missing or incomplete data
- Integration with enterprise monitoring systems

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Existing weather data pipeline (from `DAG_Accuweather_to_PostgreSQL`)
- dbt installed (`pip install dbt-postgres`)
- Apache Airflow environment
- PostgreSQL database with weather data

### Installation
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd DAG_Accuweather_dbt

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials

# 3. Configure dbt profile
cp profiles.yml.example profiles.yml
# Profiles will use environment variables from .env

# 4. Test dbt connection
dbt debug

# 5. Deploy Airflow DAG
cp dags/weather_dbt_dag.py $AIRFLOW_HOME/dags/
```

### First Run
```bash
# Manual dbt execution for testing
dbt run          # Build all models
dbt test         # Run data quality tests
dbt docs serve   # View documentation (optional)

# Deploy to Airflow for automated execution
# DAG will run automatically at 3 AM daily
```

## Business Value Delivered

### Analytics-Ready Data
- **Daily summaries** for business reporting and dashboards
- **Trend analysis** for operational planning
- **Data quality metrics** for reliability assessment
- **Historical patterns** for seasonal planning

### Operational Benefits
- **Automated data validation** catches issues early
- **Consistent business logic** across all analytics
- **Self-documenting models** reduce maintenance overhead
- **Version-controlled transformations** enable reliable changes

### Integration Examples

**Business Intelligence Queries:**
```sql
-- Weekly temperature trends for logistics planning
SELECT 
    data_date,
    avg_temperature,
    rolling_avg_7day,
    daily_trend
FROM weather_analytics.weather_trends 
WHERE data_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY data_date;

-- Temperature distribution for energy planning
SELECT 
    daily_temperature_assessment,
    COUNT(*) as days,
    AVG(avg_temperature) as avg_temp
FROM weather_analytics.daily_weather_summary
WHERE data_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'
GROUP BY daily_temperature_assessment;
```

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Connect Power BI, Tableau, or Grafana to `weather_analytics` schema
- Use `daily_weather_summary` for executive dashboards
- Use `weather_trends` for operational planning tools

## Production Considerations

### Performance
- **Materialized tables** for fast query performance
- **90-day rolling window** to control data volume
- **Indexed date columns** for time-series queries
- **Partitioning strategy** for large historical datasets

### Data Quality
- **Automated testing** with every pipeline run
- **Business rule validation** for temperature ranges
- **Data freshness checks** before transformations
- **Quality metrics** in success notifications

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Pipeline failure notifications** with detailed error context
- **Data quality alerts** when tests fail
- **Business metric summaries** for stakeholder communication
- **Integration with enterprise monitoring** systems

## Scaling Considerations

### Multiple Locations
- Parameterize models for multi-city weather data
- Add location dimensions to analysis
- Regional climate validation rules

### Enhanced Analytics
- Weather pattern recognition
- Seasonal adjustment calculations
- Predictive modeling preparation
- External data source integration

### Enterprise Features
- Role-based access control for analytics tables
- Data retention and archival policies
- Compliance and audit trail requirements
- Integration with enterprise data catalog

## Why This Stack Works

### Reliability Over Complexity
- **PostgreSQL**: Proven database that scales reliably
- **dbt**: Simple SQL-based transformations, not complex frameworks
- **Airflow**: Battle-tested orchestration with excellent monitoring

### Business-First Approach
- **Clear business value** from each data model
- **Stakeholder-friendly reporting** with meaningful metrics
- **Decision-support focus** rather than technical showcasing

### Maintenance Advantages
- **Standard SQL** that any analyst can understand and modify
- **Version-controlled logic** prevents undocumented changes
- **Automated testing** catches regressions before they impact business
- **Clear documentation** reduces onboarding time for new team members
